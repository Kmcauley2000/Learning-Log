Installing Ubuntu and setup:

First of all you need to download Ubuntu.iso from their official website 24.04.
Then create an empty virtual machine in Hyper-V - with the iso selected etc.
Once you enter it wont work with the floppy/iso selected.
Trying to "try or install ubuntu safe graphics" wont work due to the floppy/iso used for the VM.
Therefore at this screen you need to click e (to edit boot parameters)
The screen will display the lines:
  Linux    /casper/vmlinuz ---quiet splash
  initrd   /casper/initrd
You need to enter after "/castper/vmlinuz" modprobe.blacklist=floppy 
modprobe.blacklist=floppy cant be entered on the same line as not enough room, so quiet splash can be replaced with it instead.
  modprobe: The tool Linux uses to load kernel modules (device driverswho)
  blacklist= : Tells modprobe that the following module should never be loaded
  floppy: The specific kernel module for old-style floppy disk drives (the iso used)
why can quiet splash be removed? Quiet splashh only affects the boot visuals
or add another line below /casper/vmlinuz ---quiet splash
/casper/vmlinuz --- modprobe.blacklist=floppy.

Once all this is done, ubuntu will take you to the install ubuntu setup screen/GUI (which looks similar to an apple mac GUI as the desktop has a top bar. 
Once this download is complete (takes 20-40mins) it will ask you to create an account similar to windows account setup.

Next step once you are inside the Ubuntu desktop go to the terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T)
type in: sudo nano /etc/default/grub
A new screen will appear - find the line: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="" 
change it to: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="modprobe.blacklist=floppy"
save it by Ctrl+o (Enter)
exit by Ctrl+X (Exit)
Then update GRUB: sudo update-grub and accept the restart prompt.

Basic bash practise:
enter terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T)
Commands:
pwd       #Show your current directory
whoami    #show your username
uname -a  #show system info

ls        #List Files
ls -l     #Long Format list
cd /      #Go to root directory
cd ~       #Go back to your home directory 

mkdir                      # Make a folder                     so if you put: mkdir testfolder - it would make a folder named testfolder
cd                         # Go into chosen folls
der             in this instance testfolder if you type it 
touch file1.txt file2.txt  #make two files                     touch will create 2 files called file1 and file2 as .txt files
rm file2.txt               # Will remove one file
rm -r testfolder           #Remove the folder and its contents

echo "Hello Ubuntu" > hello.txt     #create file with text
cat hello.txt                       #show the contents

Code in terminal for System updates:   
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

Important to understand. You cant just enter and create random files into cd / (the root directory)
You can inside cd ~ as its like your home directory.


Own practise:
echo "this is a test file to see if i can create and open a test file in ubuntu" >testfile.txt         enter
ls         enter        =testfile.txt
cat testfile.txt        enter        =this is a test file to see if i can create and open a text file in ubuntu
