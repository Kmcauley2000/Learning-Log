What is it?
Linux is an open-source operating system - like windows or macOS.
It powers most servers, supercomputers, cloud platforms, and datacentres.
Many android phones, TVs, routers and even NVIDIA GPU's run on Linux internally. 
- Almost every NVIDIA data centre server runs on Linux - especially Ubuntu, CentOS, or Red Hat.

Linux in Data Centers
NVIDIAS Servers (like DGX systems or PU clusters) use Linux to:
  Install GPU driver & CUDA
  Run AI workloads (via Python, PyTorchm etc.)
  Monitor GPUs with DCGM or nvidiaa-smi
  Deploy containers with Docker/Kubernetes
  Automate everything with Bash or Ansible
So: Must be comfortable in Linux terminal. As theres no graphical user interface, just shell power.
Quickly explaining more on the above:

What is CUDA? Compute Unified Device Architecture
This is a programming platform by NVIDIA that lets developers run code on the GPU instead of the CPU.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why it matters:
GPUs are extremely good at doing many calculations at once (parallel computing)
CUDA lets you write programs (in C/C++/Python/etc.) that run directly on the GPU.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Real-world example:
You want to process an image using AI > instead of using the CPU, you write code with CUDA and run it on the GPU . way faster 
Summary: CUDA is NVIDIA's way of giving you access to the GPU for non-graphics, high-performance computing.
CUDA is part of the GPU's physical design - when NVIDIA build GPUs they build in: 
  CUDA Cores: Tiny processors inside the GPU optimized for parallel tasks (like AI, image processing, simulation).
  CUDA instructions: The GPU has hardware that can understand and execute special CUDA instructions.
just like a CPU has x86 instructions, a NVIDIA GPU has CUDA instructions. 
But to use the CUDA hardware you also need the CUDA software toolkit which includes:
  CUDA Driver: talks to the GPU hardware
  CUDA runtime: Lets your programs use CUDA
  cuBLAS/cuDNN: Libraries for fast math, deep learning, etc.
  nvcc: CUDA compiler
  nvidia-smi: Tool to monitor GPU
SO what happens when you run a CUDA-powered program?
1. If you have a python code that says "send this matric to the GPU"
2. PyTorch uses CUDA instructions to prepare that data.(with its cuBLAS/cuDNN)
3. The CUDA driver talks to the GPU
4. The GPU hardware (CUDA cores) runs the computation.
5. You get results - way faster than CPU
      WHY DOES ANY OF THIS CUDA STUFF MATTER? 
On Linx servers, you must manually install the NVIDIA GPU driver + CUDA toolkit, just like any other system - because Linux doesnt come with them preinstalled.
so if you are using bash in Linux to get a GPU driver you would do something like:
      sudo apt install nvidia-driver-xxx
then reboot and run: 
      nvidia-smi
If it works, youll see GPU info.
