<Window x:Class="MyFirstApp.MainWindow" 
        xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
        Title="Hello" Height="300" Width="400">
    <Grid> 
        <Button Content="Click Me!" Width="100" Height="30" />
    </Grid>
</Window>


Understanding this code step by step.

Line 1:
<Window> is the root element. This defines the main window of your app - like the main screen
x:Class+"MyFirstApp.MainWindow" links this XAML file to a C# code file called MainWindow.xaml.cs - where the logic goes.
This line is like the "this is a component, which is part of the main component of my app.

Line 2:
xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
This namespace tells XAML: "use the WPF library to understand what elements like <Button> and <Grid> mean.
So best way to understand this in my terms - is its similar to Unity:
when you put:
Using UnityEngine
Using System.collections
so basically this XAML line equivalent is fetching the classes which are like tool templates to use. Which in this instance is in the WPF library.

Line 3;
Title="Hello" Height="300" Width="400">
Titile: Text shown in the window title bar
Height: How tall the window is (in pixels) 
Width: How wide the window is (in pixels)

Line 4:
<Grid>
A grid is a layout container - it helps you organise where controls go (similar to a vertical layout group component in Unity)
Its like a blank canvas to arrange your buttons, textboxes, etc.
This opens a grid block - everything inside it is part of the layout

Line 5:
<Button Content="Click Me!" Width="100" Height="30" />
This line creates a button
Content: Is the text shown on the button
Width: The buttons width in pixels
Height: The buttons height in pixels
So this line is basically saying "put a button inside the window, gives the dimensions and label it "click me!" 

Line 6:
</Grid>
This line closes the grid element

Line 7: 
</Window>
This line closes the window element

This file script would create something that looks like:
+-----------------------------+
|        Hello (title)        |
|                             |
|       [ Click Me! ]         |
|                             |
+-----------------------------+
