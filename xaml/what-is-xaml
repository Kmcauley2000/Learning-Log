# What is XAML? 

XAML stands for Extensible Application Markup Language.

Used in WPF apps (Windows Presentation Foundation - Its a microsoft technology used to build desktops applications for windows. A WPF app is a windows program with a GUI built using WPF.)
Its a declarative language
similar to HTML but for windows based apps 

Today i had a piece of software that ran into a "System.Windows.Baml2006.TypeConverterMarkupExtension" error - which led to me wanting to understand exact what XAML is.
